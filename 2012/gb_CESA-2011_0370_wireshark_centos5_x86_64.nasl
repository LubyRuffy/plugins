  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Wireshark. If Wireshark
  opened a specially-crafted capture file, it could crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-0024)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2010-3445, CVE-2011-0538, CVE-2011-1139,
  CVE-2011-1140, CVE-2011-1141, CVE-2011-1143)

  Users of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances of
  Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.");
