  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0080,
  CVE-2011-0081)

  An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
  malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0078)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
  frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
  the 'rows' and 'cols' attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-0077)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
  with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
  trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0075)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
  malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0074)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
  Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0073)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
  iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
  Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0072)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
  handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
  accessible to the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0071)

  A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  'application/http-index-format' documents. A malformed HTTP response could
  cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0070)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
  requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
  JavaScript reque ...
