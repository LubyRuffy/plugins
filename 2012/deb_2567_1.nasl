CVE-2012-4730
Authenticated users can add arbitrary headers or content to
mail generated by RT.

CVE-2012-4732
A CSRF vulnerability may allow attackers to toggle ticket
bookmarks.

CVE-2012-4734
If users follow a crafted URI and log in to RT, they may
trigger actions which would ordinarily blocked by the CSRF
prevention logic.

CVE-2012-4735
Several different vulnerabilities in GnuPG processing allow
attackers to cause RT to improperly sign outgoing email.

CVE-2012-4884
If GnuPG support is enabled, authenticated users attackers can
create arbitrary files as the web server user, which may
enable arbitrary code execution.

Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
server, you must stop and start Apache manually.  The restart
mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-2 of the request-tracker4 package.");
