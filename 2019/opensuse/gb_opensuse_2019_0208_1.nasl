  Security vulnerablities addressed:

  - CVE-2019-5736: Effectively copying /proc/self/exe during re-exec to
  avoid write attacks to the host runc binary, which could lead to a
  container breakout (bsc#1121967)

  - CVE-2018-16873: Fix a remote command execution during 'go get -u'
  (boo#1118897)

  - CVE-2018-16874: Fix a directory traversal in 'go get' via curly braces
  in import paths (boo#1118898)

  - CVE-2018-16875: Fix a CPU denial of service issue (boo#1118899)

  Other changes and bug fixes:

  - Update go requirements to  = go1.10

  - Create a symlink in /usr/bin/runc to enable rootless Podman and Buildah.

  - Make use of %license macro

  - Remove 'go test' from %check section, as it has only ever caused us
  problems and hasn't (as far as I remember) ever caught a
  release-blocking issue. Smoke testing has been far more useful.
  (boo#1095817)

  - Upgrade to runc v1.0.0~rc6.
