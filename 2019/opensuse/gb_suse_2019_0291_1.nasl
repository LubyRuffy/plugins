  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for procps fixes the following security issues:

  - CVE-2018-1122: Prevent local privilege escalation in top. If a user ran
  top with HOME unset in an attacker-controlled directory, the attacker
  could have achieved privilege escalation by exploiting one of several
  vulnerabilities in the config_file() function (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1123: Prevent denial of service in ps via mmap buffer overflow.
  Inbuilt protection in ps maped a guard page at the end of the overflowed
  buffer, ensuring that the impact of this flaw is limited to a crash
  (temporary denial of service) (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1124: Prevent multiple integer overflows leading to a heap
  corruption in file2strvec function. This allowed a privilege escalation
  for a local attacker who can create entries in procfs by starting
  processes, which could result in crashes or arbitrary code execution in
  proc utilities run by
  other users (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1125: Prevent stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This
  vulnerability was mitigated by FORTIFY limiting the impact to a crash
  (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1126: Ensure correct integer size in proc/alloc.* to prevent
  truncation/integer overflow issues (bsc#1092100).

  (These issues were previously released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP3
  and SP4.)

  Also the following non-security issue was fixed:

  - Fix CPU summary showing old data. (bsc#1121753)

  This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.
