(CVE-2018-14625)

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in
environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM
virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local
attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative
privileges in a host machine. (CVE-2018-16882)

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19407)

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked
uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker
could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
