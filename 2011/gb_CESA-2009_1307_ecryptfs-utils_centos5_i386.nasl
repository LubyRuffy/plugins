  eCryptfs is released as a Technology Preview for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  5.4. These updated ecryptfs-utils packages have been upgraded to upstream
  version 75, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. In addition, these packages provide a graphical program
  to help configure and use eCryptfs. To start this program, run the command:

  	ecryptfs-mount-helper-gui

  Important: the syntax of certain eCryptfs mount options has changed. Users
  who were previously using the initial Technology Preview release of
  ecryptfs-utils are advised to refer to the ecryptfs(7) man page, and to
  update any affected mount scripts and /etc/fstab entries for eCryptfs file
  systems.

  A disclosure flaw was found in the way the 'ecryptfs-setup-private' script
  passed passphrases to the 'ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase' and
  'ecryptfs-add-passphrase' commands as command line arguments. A local user
  could obtain the passphrases of other users who were running the script
  from the process listing. (CVE-2008-5188)

  These updated packages provide various enhancements, including a mount
  helper and supporting libraries to perform key management and mounting
  functions.

  Notable enhancements include:

  * a new package, ecryptfs-utils-gui, has been added to this update. This
  package depends on the pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade packages and provides the
  eCryptfs Mount Helper GUI program. To install the GUI, first install
  ecryptfs-utils and then issue the following command:

  	yum install ecryptfs-utils-gui

  (BZ#500997)

  * the 'ecryptfs-rewrite-file' utility is now more intelligent when dealing
  with non-existent files and with filtering special files such as the '.'
  directory. In addition, the progress output from 'ecryptfs-rewrite-file'
  has been improved and is now more explicit about the success status of each
  target. (BZ#500813)

  * descriptions of the 'verbose' flag and the 'verbosity=[x]' option, where
  [x] is either 0 or 1, were missing from a number of eCryptfs manual pages,
  and have been added. Refer to the eCryptfs man pages for important
  information regarding using the verbose and/or verbosity options.
  (BZ#470444)

  These updated packages also fix the following bugs:

  * mounting a directory using the eCryptfs mount helper with an RSA key that
  was too small did not allow the eCryptfs mou ...
