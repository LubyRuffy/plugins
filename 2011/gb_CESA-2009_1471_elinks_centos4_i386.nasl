  it does support frames, tables, and most other HTML tags.

  An off-by-one buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way ELinks handled
  its internal cache of string representations for HTML special entities. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted HTML file
  that would cause ELinks to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when
  rendered. (CVE-2008-7224)

  It was discovered that ELinks tried to load translation files using
  relative paths. A local attacker able to trick a victim into running ELinks
  in a folder containing specially-crafted translation files could use this
  flaw to confuse the victim via incorrect translations, or cause ELinks to
  crash and possibly execute arbitrary code via embedded formatting sequences
  in translated messages. (CVE-2007-2027)
