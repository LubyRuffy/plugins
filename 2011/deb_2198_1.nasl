of scripts and configuration files necessary for TeX, contains insecure
settings for the shell_escape_commands directive.  Depending on the
scenario, this may result in arbitrary code execution when a victim is
tricked into processing a malicious tex-file or this is done in an
automated fashion.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem due
to shell_escape being disabled.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08.1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.");
