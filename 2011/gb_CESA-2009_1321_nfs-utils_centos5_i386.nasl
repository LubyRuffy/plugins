  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools.

  It was discovered that nfs-utils did not use tcp_wrappers correctly.
  Certain hosts access rules defined in '/etc/hosts.allow' and
  '/etc/hosts.deny' may not have been honored, possibly allowing remote
  attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2008-4552)

  This updated package also fixes the following bugs:

  * the 'LOCKD_TCPPORT' and 'LOCKD_UDPPORT' options in '/etc/sysconfig/nfs'
  were not honored: the lockd daemon continued to use random ports. With this
  update, these options are honored. (BZ#434795)

  * it was not possible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has
  the '/etc/' directory mounted on a read-only file system (this could occur
  on systems with an NFS-mounted root file system). With this update, it is
  possible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has '/etc/' mounted
  on a read-only file system. (BZ#450646)

  * arguments specified by 'STATDARG=' in '/etc/sysconfig/nfs' were removed
  by the nfslock init script, meaning the arguments specified were never
  passed to rpc.statd. With this update, the nfslock init script no longer
  removes these arguments. (BZ#459591)

  * when mounting an NFS file system from a host not specified in the NFS
  server's '/etc/exports' file, a misleading 'unknown host' error was logged
  on the server (the hostname lookup did not fail). With this update, a
  clearer error message is provided for these situations. (BZ#463578)

  * the nhfsstone benchmark utility did not work with NFS version 3 and 4.
  This update adds support to nhfsstone for NFS version 3 and 4. The new
  nhfsstone '-2', '-3', and '-4' options are used to select an NFS version
  (similar to nfsstat(8)). (BZ#465933)

  * the exportfs(8) manual page contained a spelling mistake, 'djando', in
  the EXAMPLES section. (BZ#474848)

  * in some situations the NFS server incorrectly refused mounts to hosts
  that had a host alias in a NIS netgroup. (BZ#478952)

  * in some situations the NFS client used its cache, rather than using
  the latest version of a file or directory from a given export. This update
  adds a new mount option, 'lookupcache=', which allows the NFS client to
  control how it caches files and directories. Note: The Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.4 kernel update (the fourth regular update) must be installed in
  order to use the 'lookupcache=' option.
