Pacemaker and Corosync utilities.

A command injection flaw was found in the pcsd web UI. An attacker able to
trick a victim that was logged in to the pcsd web UI into visiting a
specially crafted URL could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges on the server hosting the web UI. (CVE-2015-5190)

A race condition was found in the way the pcsd web UI backend performed
authorization of user requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a
request that would be evaluated as originating from a different user,
potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with permissions of a
more privileged user. (CVE-2015-5189)

These issues were discovered by Tom Jelnek of Red Hat.

contain backported patches to correct these issues.");
