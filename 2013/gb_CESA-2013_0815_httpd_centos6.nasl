  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_proxy_balancer
  module's manager web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the manager web interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's manager interface session. (CVE-2012-4558)

  It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
  its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
  a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
  terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
  the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
  execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_info, mod_status,
  mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An attacker could
  possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were able to make
  the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a specially-crafted Host
  header. (CVE-2012-3499)

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.");
