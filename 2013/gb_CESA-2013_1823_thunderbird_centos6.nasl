Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2013-5609, CVE-2013-5616, CVE-2013-5618, CVE-2013-6671, CVE-2013-5613)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird rendered web content with missing
character encoding information. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly
bypass same-origin inheritance and perform cross site-scripting (XSS)
attacks. (CVE-2013-5612)

It was found that certain malicious web content could bypass restrictions
applied by sandboxed iframes. An attacker could combine this flaw with
other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5614)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ben Turner, Bobby Holley, Jesse Ruderman, Christian
Holler, Masato Kinugawa, Daniel Veditz, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Nils, Tyson
Smith, and Atte Kettunen as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.2.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.2.0 ESR, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.");
