  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name
  Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

  It was discovered that dnsmasq, when used in combination with certain
  libvirtd configurations, could incorrectly process network packets from
  network interfaces that were intended to be prohibited. A remote,
  unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
  service via DNS amplification attacks. (CVE-2012-3411)

  In order to fully address this issue, libvirt package users are advised to
  install updated libvirt packages. Refer to RHSA-2013:0276 for additional
  information.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Due to a regression, the lease change script was disabled. Consequently,
  the 'dhcp-script' option in the /etc/dnsmasq.conf configuration file did
  not work. This update corrects the problem and the 'dhcp-script' option now
  works as expected. (BZ#815819)

  This update also adds the following enhancements:

  * Prior to this update, dnsmasq did not validate that the tftp directory
  given actually existed and was a directory. Consequently, configuration
  errors were not immediately reported on startup. This update improves the
  code to validate the tftp root directory option. As a result, fault finding
  is simplified especially when dnsmasq is called by external processes such
  as libvirt. (BZ#824214)

  * When two or more dnsmasq processes were running with DHCP enabled on one
  interface, DHCP RELEASE packets were sometimes lost. Consequently, when two
  or more dnsmasq processes were running with DHCP enabled on one interface,
  releasing IP addresses sometimes failed. This  ...
