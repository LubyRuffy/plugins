  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Network Security Services (NSS) is a set
of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of
security-enabled client and server applications. The nss-util packages provide
utilities for use with the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. Netscape
Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI operating
system facilities.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: nss
3.21.0, nss-util 3.21.0, nspr 4.11.0. (BZ#1300629, BZ#1299874, BZ#1299861)

Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way NSS handled DHE
(Diffie-Hellman key exchange) and ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
exchange) handshake messages. A remote attacker could send a specially
crafted handshake message that, when parsed by an application linked
against NSS, would cause that application to crash or, under certain
special conditions, execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the
user running the application. (CVE-2016-1978)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way NSS processed certain DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded cryptographic keys. An attacker
could use this flaw to create a specially crafted DER encoded certificate
which, when parsed by an application compiled against the NSS library,
could cause that application to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the
permissions of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-1979)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla Project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Eric Rescorla as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-1978 and Tim Taubert as the original reporter of CVE-2016-1979.");
